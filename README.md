# Visual Bubble Sort

I was bored, so I made a dynamically scaling visual representation of a bubble-sort algorithm.

That's what all sane people do when their bored... right?!


### To run the code:
```bash
  # download the visualbubble.py file
  cd path/to/file/folder
  python visualbubble.py
```
